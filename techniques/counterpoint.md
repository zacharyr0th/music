The following are some basic guidelines to two-part writing. These guidelines are based on statistics and are abridged as much as possible to encourage a fairly liberal view of what is acceptable.

1:1 (Note against note)

- Mostly consonant intervals are to be used. Of these, the 6th the 3rd and the octave should appear with greatest frequency.

Consecutive intervals should be limited. As a general rule, an interval should not be used no more than three or four times in succession (thirds, sixths, tenths).

- Avoid all parallel octaves and fifths.
- In most circumstances one should avoid parallel and similar motion into and out of PS and P8 (an example of an exception is the "horn 5th," which is similar motion descending from a 3rd to a P5, or ascending from a 6"' to a P5).
- Seek contrary motion when possible. This creates more independence between the lines.
- Approach P5 and P8 by contrary or oblique motion; if contrary, move one part by step.
- Usually, if one line skips or leaps, the other proceeds stepwise or remains on the same pitch (a common exception might be a voice exchange in a single chord). Do not use P4 (vertically). As a working rule, repeated tones are to be avoided in 1:1 style. If they are used, the harmony should change on the second tone (if there is a repeated tone, the other voice should step, skip or leap). Vertical dissonant intervals such as the TT and m7 can be used in the 18th Century style for (implied) dominant and diminished type chords. One should be cognizant of their inherent voice-leading considerations (tendency tones). Keep parts close but independent (stay within a tenth most of the time). Lines should not "overlap" (when the lower voice moves above the former position of the upper voice or vice versa). Voices also should not cross.
- 2:1 (2 notes against 1 note)
- The primary new feature that will be encountered in 2:1 counterpoint is the use of non-harmonic tones and the dissonant intervals they create.
- If both tones in the counterpoint belong to the same harmony there will be a skip between them.
- In strict two-part 2:1 writing, repeated tones should not be sounded in the counterpoint against any cantus firmus tone, as this is a reversion, in a contrapuntal sense, to I:1.
- Non-harmonic tones must be resolved stepwise (the chief exception being the escape tone).
- Treat P4 as a dissonance to be resolved.
