serial techniques

Serial row	A series of pitches that are used as the basis for a musical composition. The serial row can be used in its original form, or it can be inverted, retrograded, or retrograded-inverted.
Prime form	The original form of the serial row.
Retrograde	The serial row played backwards.
Inversion	The serial row with the intervals inverted.
Retrograde inversion	The serial row played backwards with the intervals inverted.

species counterpoint

The following are some basic guidelines to two-part writing. These guidelines are based on statistics and are abridged as much as possible to encourage a fairly liberal view of what is acceptable.

1:1 (Note against note)

- Mostly consonant intervals are to be used. Of these, the 6th the 3rd and the octave should appear with greatest frequency.

Consecutive intervals should be limited. As a general rule, an interval should not be used no more than three or four times in succession (thirds, sixths, tenths).

- Avoid all parallel octaves and fifths.
- In most circumstances one should avoid parallel and similar motion into and out of PS and P8 (an example of an exception is the "horn 5th," which is similar motion descending from a 3rd to a P5, or ascending from a 6"' to a P5).
- Seek contrary motion when possible. This creates more independence between the lines.
- Approach P5 and P8 by contrary or oblique motion; if contrary, move one part by step.
- Usually, if one line skips or leaps, the other proceeds stepwise or remains on the same pitch (a common exception might be a voice exchange in a single chord). Do not use P4 (vertically). As a working rule, repeated tones are to be avoided in 1:1 style. If they are used, the harmony should change on the second tone (if there is a repeated tone, the other voice should step, skip or leap). Vertical dissonant intervals such as the TT and m7 can be used in the 18th Century style for (implied) dominant and diminished type chords. One should be cognizant of their inherent voice-leading considerations (tendency tones). Keep parts close but independent (stay within a tenth most of the time). Lines should not "overlap" (when the lower voice moves above the former position of the upper voice or vice versa). Voices also should not cross.
- 2:1 (2 notes against 1 note)
- The primary new feature that will be encountered in 2:1 counterpoint is the use of non-harmonic tones and the dissonant intervals they create.
- If both tones in the counterpoint belong to the same harmony there will be a skip between them.
- In strict two-part 2:1 writing, repeated tones should not be sounded in the counterpoint against any cantus firmus tone, as this is a reversion, in a contrapuntal sense, to I:1.
- Non-harmonic tones must be resolved stepwise (the chief exception being the escape tone).
- Treat P4 as a dissonance to be resolved.

non-harmonic tones

Non-harmonic tones	Notes that do not belong to the chord that is currently being played. They are used to add interest and variety to the melody.
Passing tones	Non-harmonic tones that move by step between two chord tones. They are used to fill in the space between chord tones and create a smooth melodic line.
Neighboring tones	Non-harmonic tones that move by step to and from a chord tone. They are used to add ornamentation to the melody.
Escape tones	Non-harmonic tones that move by step from a chord tone to a non-chord tone and then resolve back to the chord tone. They are used to create a sense of motion and direction in the melody.
Appoggiaturas	Non-harmonic tones that are approached by leap and then resolve by step to a chord tone. They are used to add emphasis to a chord tone.
Suspensions	Non-harmonic tones that are held over from one chord to the next and then resolve by step to a chord tone. They are used to create a sense of tension and release in the music.
Retardations	Non-harmonic tones that resolve by step to a chord tone that is lower than the chord tone they are approaching. They are used to create a sense of surprise or emphasis in the music.
Anticipations	Non-harmonic tones that resolve by step to a chord tone that is higher than the chord tone they are approaching. They are used to create a sense of forward motion or anticipation in the music.

transpositions

Diminutive revolution	Changing keys based on the notes derived from a o7 chord.	A piece in C minor could be transposed to Gb minor by using the notes of the o7 chord CEbGbA as the basis for the new key.
Augmented revolution	Changing keys based on the notes from an + triad.	A piece in C major could be transposed to E major by using the notes of the + triad (CEAb) as the basis for the new key.
Diatonic transposition	Changing keys by a whole step or half step as directed by the scale pattern.	A piece in C major could be transposed to D dorian by moving up a whole step in the C major scale.
Chromatic transposition	Changing keys by any number of semitones.	A piece in C major could be transposed to any key by moving up or down any number of semitones.
Oblique motion	Changing keys by moving the melody up or down a fifth while keeping the harmony the same.	A piece in C major could be transposed to G major by moving the melody up a fifth, while keeping the harmony in C major.
Real transposition	Changing keys by changing both the melody and the harmony.	A piece in C major could be transposed to G major by changing both the melody and the harmony to G major.
Secondary Subs	Inserting a passing chord into a chord sequence that transitions a key from one to another via dominant, leading tone, tritone, or negative substitutions.	

texture

monophonic	melody without harmony
polyphonic	2 or more melodic lines
homophonic	melody with harmonic/rhythmic accomponent
homorhythmic	sameness in rhythm in all parts
biphonic	2 distinct lines, the lower contains a constant pith/drone and one is played or sung by 2 or more parts
heterophonic	one is played or sung by two or more parts simultaneously in a different rhythm or temp
